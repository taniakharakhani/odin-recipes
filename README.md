This is a project dedicated to practicing what I have learned from HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). I will update when I begin the project and will write my concluding words.

The project was relativley easy for me, as I have had some experience with HTML prior to this project. However, I noticed my organization got much better. The code is easily readable and not just thrown in there as I have previously done.

While compiling the commands on the command line, I did need to go back into my notes to refresh myself on what to type, but afterwards? Easy. I'm sure with even more usage of the command line in these projects, i'll be more advanced.

For sure, if you are just beginning, everything will look confusing. And it won't take you an hour to complete, it will take you hours or days, even weeks! That's okay! The most important thing is to keep trying and to try your best. If you're really stuck, there is no shame in searching for the answer.
